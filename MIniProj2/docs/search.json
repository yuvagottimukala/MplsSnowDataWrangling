The data was collected from Open Minneapolis, from which we used, Snow Emergency Tags – 2022/2023 Season #4 Northrop (1/4/23 thru 1/6/23) and Snow Emergency Tows – 2022/2023 Season #4 Northrop (1/4/23 thru 1/6/23).\nI have made three graphics to visualize tags and tows, each of which are described in detail below. This was a very intresting project and was oddly engaging. I was under the assumption that I would just mutate the data and slap it in a ggplot with a plain theme and submit like I have been doing. However, turns out there is so much to R and Quarto files than I have probably time for this semester but I feel like I got my toes in the water with this one. From learning about Yml themes from quarto, being able to make a Yml file and using some html aspects to be able to make a somewhat visually pleasing website.\nMy main question im hoping to answer with this project is what ward/neighborhood has the most issues with parking in the winter?\nPlot 1\nThis plot is showing the 3 violation types and the count for the number of tags issued for each type. One observation is that Even Address street parking was the biggest violation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 2\nThis is a plot that shows tow counts per neighborhood and the biggest observation here is that Whittier has the most tows by far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 3\nThis is a plot that shows total violation counts per neighborhood(tows and tags) and the biggest observation here is that Whittier still comes out on top. after a summer of painting in and around Whittier I can see why this would be the case as parking there sucks. Too many cars and not enough street spots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion,\nThe plots above show that Whittier is the most prominent neighborhood when it comes to parking in the winter. I think there are many reasons this could be, such as: Population density, cars to parking spots ratio, avalable street parking spots and so on. More research will have to be done to accurately say what is the reasoning behind the high violations and tows. For now though, we have answered our question and can proceed with furthur research.\nvvv All code below for 3 plots vvvv\n\n##load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(postcards)\n\ntows &lt;-read_csv(\"Snow_Emergency_Northrop_Tows_2023.csv\")\ntags &lt;-read_csv(\"Snow_Emergency_Northrop_Tags_2023.csv\")\n\n##### DATA FRAME PLOT ONE #####\nmy_tags &lt;- tags |&gt;\n  group_by(Violation)|&gt;\n  summarise(z = n())\n\n##### DATA FRAME PLOT TWO #####\nmy_tows &lt;- tows |&gt;\n  group_by(Neighborho)|&gt;\n  summarise(tot = n())\n\n##### PLOT ONE #####\nggplot(data=my_tags, aes(x=Violation, y=z,fill = z)) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"coral\")+\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust=0.5)) + \ntheme(text = element_text(size = 9),element_line(size =1))+\n  labs(\n  title = \"3 Violation Types And Their Accumulative Conts\"\n  )+\nxlab(\"Violation Types\") + ylab(\"Total Violations\")\n##### PLOT TWO #####\nggplot(data=my_tows, aes(x=Neighborho, y=tot,fill = tot)) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"coral\")+\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust=0.5)) +\ntheme(text = element_text(size = 9),element_line(size =1))+\n  labs(\n  title = \"Tow Counts Per Neighborhood\"\n  )+\nxlab(\"Neighborhoods\") + ylab(\"Total Tows \")\n##### DATA FRAME PLOT THREE #####\njoinTowTags &lt;- tags|&gt;\n  left_join(tows)|&gt;\n  group_by(Neighborho)|&gt;\n  summarise(total = n())\n\n\n##### PLOT THREE #####\nggplot(data=joinTowTags, aes(x=Neighborho, y=total,fill = total)) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"coral\")+\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust=0.5)) +\ntheme(text = element_text(size = 9),element_line(size =1))+\n  labs(\n  title = \"Total Tow and Tag Counts Per Neighborhood\"\n  )+\nxlab(\"Neighborhoods\") + ylab(\"Total Count \")"
