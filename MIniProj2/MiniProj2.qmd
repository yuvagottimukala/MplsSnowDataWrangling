# Miniproject 2!

The point of this miniproject was to be able to make sensible graphics from 2 
very rich datasets. The data was collected from Open Minneapolis, from which we used, 
Snow Emergency Tags – 2022/2023 Season #4 Northrop (1/4/23 thru 1/6/23) and Snow 
Emergency Tows – 2022/2023 Season #4 Northrop (1/4/23 thru 1/6/23).

I have made three graphics to visualize tags and tows, each of which are described 
in detail below. This was a very intresting project and was oddly engaging. I was under 
the assumption that I would just mutate the data and slap it in a ggplot with a plain theme
and submit like I have been doing. However, turns out there is so much to R and Quarto files
than I have probably time for this semester but I feel like I got my toes in the water with 
this one. From learning about Yml themes from quarto, being able to make a Yml file and 
using some html aspects to be able to make a somewhat visually pleasing website. 

My main question im hoping to answer with this project is what ward/neighborhood has the 
most issues with parking in the winter?


# Plot 1

This plot is showing the 3 violation types and the count for the number of tags issued for 
each type. One observation is that Even Address street parking was the biggest violation. 


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/unnamed-chunk-1-1 copy.png")
```


# Plot 2

This is a plot that shows tow counts per neighborhood and the biggest observation here
is that Whittier has the most tows by far.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/unnamed-chunk-2-1 copy.png")
```




# Plot 3

This is a plot that shows total violation counts per neighborhood(tows and tags) and the 
biggest observation here is that Whittier still comes out on top. after a summer of painting
in and around Whittier I can see why this would be the case as parking there sucks. Too many
cars and not enough street spots. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/unnamed-chunk-3-1 copy.png")
```



# In conclusion, 

The plots above show that Whittier is the most prominent neighborhood when it comes to 
parking in the winter. I think there are many reasons this could be, such as: Population density, 
cars to parking spots ratio, avalable street parking spots and so on. More research will have to be 
done to accurately say what is the reasoning behind the high violations and tows. For now though, we 
have answered our question and can proceed with furthur research.
