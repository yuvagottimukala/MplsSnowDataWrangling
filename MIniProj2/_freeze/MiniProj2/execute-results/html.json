The data was collected from Open Minneapolis, from which we used, \nSnow Emergency Tags – 2022/2023 Season #4 Northrop (1/4/23 thru 1/6/23) and Snow \nEmergency Tows – 2022/2023 Season #4 Northrop (1/4/23 thru 1/6/23).\n\nI have made three graphics to visualize tags and tows, each of which are described \nin detail below. This was a very intresting project and was oddly engaging. I was under \nthe assumption that I would just mutate the data and slap it in a ggplot with a plain theme\nand submit like I have been doing. However, turns out there is so much to R and Quarto files\nthan I have probably time for this semester but I feel like I got my toes in the water with \nthis one. From learning about Yml themes from quarto, being able to make a Yml file and \nusing some html aspects to be able to make a somewhat visually pleasing website. \n\nMy main question im hoping to answer with this project is what ward/neighborhood has the \nmost issues with parking in the winter?\n\n\n# Plot 1\n\nThis plot is showing the 3 violation types and the count for the number of tags issued for \neach type. One observation is that Even Address street parking was the biggest violation. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/unnamed-chunk-1-1 copy.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Plot 2\n\nThis is a plot that shows tow counts per neighborhood and the biggest observation here\nis that Whittier has the most tows by far.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/unnamed-chunk-2-1 copy.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 3\n\nThis is a plot that shows total violation counts per neighborhood(tows and tags) and the \nbiggest observation here is that Whittier still comes out on top. after a summer of painting\nin and around Whittier I can see why this would be the case as parking there sucks. Too many\ncars and not enough street spots. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/unnamed-chunk-3-1 copy.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# In conclusion, \n\nThe plots above show that Whittier is the most prominent neighborhood when it comes to \nparking in the winter. I think there are many reasons this could be, such as: Population density, \ncars to parking spots ratio, avalable street parking spots and so on. More research will have to be \ndone to accurately say what is the reasoning behind the high violations and tows. For now though, we \nhave answered our question and can proceed with furthur research.\n\n# vvv All code below for 3 plots vvvv\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(postcards)\n\ntows <-read_csv(\"Snow_Emergency_Northrop_Tows_2023.csv\")\ntags <-read_csv(\"Snow_Emergency_Northrop_Tags_2023.csv\")\n\n##### DATA FRAME PLOT ONE #####\nmy_tags <- tags |>\n  group_by(Violation)|>\n  summarise(z = n())\n\n##### DATA FRAME PLOT TWO #####\nmy_tows <- tows |>\n  group_by(Neighborho)|>\n  summarise(tot = n())\n\n##### PLOT ONE #####\nggplot(data=my_tags, aes(x=Violation, y=z,fill = z)) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"coral\")+\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust=0.5)) + \ntheme(text = element_text(size = 9),element_line(size =1))+\n  labs(\n  title = \"3 Violation Types And Their Accumulative Conts\"\n  )+\nxlab(\"Violation Types\") + ylab(\"Total Violations\")\n```\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##### PLOT TWO #####\nggplot(data=my_tows, aes(x=Neighborho, y=tot,fill = tot)) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"coral\")+\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust=0.5)) +\ntheme(text = element_text(size = 9),element_line(size =1))+\n  labs(\n  title = \"Tow Counts Per Neighborhood\"\n  )+\nxlab(\"Neighborhoods\") + ylab(\"Total Tows \")\n```\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##### DATA FRAME PLOT THREE #####\njoinTowTags <- tags|>\n  left_join(tows)|>\n  group_by(Neighborho)|>\n  summarise(total = n())\n\n\n##### PLOT THREE #####\nggplot(data=joinTowTags, aes(x=Neighborho, y=total,fill = total)) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"coral\")+\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust=0.5)) +\ntheme(text = element_text(size = 9),element_line(size =1))+\n  labs(\n  title = \"Total Tow and Tag Counts Per Neighborhood\"\n  )+\nxlab(\"Neighborhoods\") + ylab(\"Total Count \")\n```\n:::\n",
