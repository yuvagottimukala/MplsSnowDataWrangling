# MplsSnowDataWrangling
 The point of this miniproject was to be able to make sensible graphics from 2  very rich datasets. The data was collected from Open Minneapolis, from which we used,
 Snow Emergency Tags – 2022/2023 Season #4 Northrop (1/4/23 thru 1/6/23) and Snow  Emergency Tows – 2022/2023 Season #4 Northrop (1/4/23 thru 1/6/23).
